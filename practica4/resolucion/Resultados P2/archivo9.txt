            One potato, two potato: Contemporary work at Harvard Art Museums 
 
 
 
 
 
             On view in the Harvard Art Museums is a clever work by the conceptual Argentine artist Victor Grippo. &#8220;Analgoia I" incorporates a series of potatoes connected to electrodes and a meter that registers the energy they produce. The piece is both an example of the artist's unusual use of everyday materials and a statement about how a united community could resist the nation&#8217;s repressive political regime.
