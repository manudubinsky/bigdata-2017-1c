          Under the state&#8217;s Unclaimed Property Law, holders such as financial institutions, corporations, business associations, and insurance companies report and submit unclaimed property (e.g., bank accounts, stocks, bonds, uncashed checks, and safe deposit box contents) to the State Controller&#8217;s Office when there has been no activity on an account for three years. Property can be claimed directly by the owner or heir without any service charge or filing fee.
